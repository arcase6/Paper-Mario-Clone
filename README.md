# Paper-Mario-Clone
A toy project created with the goal of reproducing the battle system of Paper Mario

This project was made over the span of a few months with the goal of getting some more practice
in making games. I chose paper mario because it seemed simple

All assets and scripts in the project were made by myself from scratch (in many cases multiple times). 

The project as it stands is imcomplete, but could be expanded to include all the functionality if required.

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>Jump Attack</li>

<li> Enemy Goomba (with animation) </lI>

</ul>
